## Templates
Templates define how a developer interacts with drivers and resources on the Porter dashboard. Templates are fully customizable: you can start with our prebuilt templates, which attempt to accommodate most developer use-cases, or you can create your own. 

## Drivers
Drivers are ways to interface with cloud resources, like infrastructure or application configuration. The built-in drivers add support for nearly all cloud providers and configurations. Supported drivers are:
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Helm

## Resources 
Resources are the created resources on the target cloud provider, cluster, etc. Every developer interacts with resources through Drivers. 

## Views
Views that a developer has access to. All views can be access-controlled via RBAC. 

## Actions 
Actions that a developer can take. All actions can be access-controlled via RBAC and audited.
